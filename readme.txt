Geolocate your posts and display them on an interactive OpenStreetMap map using a simple shortcode. Customize your markers and map. 


== Description ==
Travelers' Map allows you to display your blog posts on a dynamic map using the Leaflet module and OpenStreetMap open data. This plugin is entirely free.

See this plugin in action on my [hiking blog](https://camilles-travels.com/la-carte/).
How to use: [Get started with Travelers' Map](https://camilles-travels.com/get-started-with-travelers-map-wordpress-plugin/)
[Developers documentation](https://camilles-travels.com/get-started-with-travelers-map-wordpress-plugin/#dev-documentation)

= Features of Travelers' Map =

* **Geolocalize your posts, pages or custom post types** on a map and choose the marker image. A **search module** is available to quickly locate the desired location.
* Add your own images to **customize your markers**.
* **Insert a dynamic map** that displays your articles using a **simple shortcode**. Choose the dimensions of your map.
* **Filter the posts** you want to display on the map by their type, categories and tags.
* **Markers clustering** is automatic when marker density is too high, to prevent them from overlapping.
* **Customize** the appearance of your maps with OpenStreetMap tile providers. By default, the plugin uses CARTO's free and open "Voyager" map tiles.
* **Customize** the popup style and content for your markers. You can also disable the plugin's CSS if you want to design your own popups.
* Travelers' Map is **compatible with the new Gutenberg editor** and the classic editor.
* This plugin **does not add any tables into your database**.

The geolocation data of your posts are saved as meta-data and **are not deleted if Travelers' Map is disabled or deleted**. However, if you want to uninstall Travelers' Map permanently, an option is available to **clean your database of any data added by the plugin**.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this open source and free of charge? =
Yes, it is. This plugin uses [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) to display the interactive maps. [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) open data is used. By default, this plugin uses [CARTO’s Voyager](https://carto.com/attribution/) tiles, which require attribution but are free. 

However, you may have to pay if you were to choose a premium Tile Provider.

= How can I find free tile providers to customize my map? =
You should visit the awesome [Leaflet-providers demo](https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/) to find a tile provider. Some of them require to register and request an API key.

= Can I use Google Maps = 
No, I decided to create Travelers' Map after Google Maps' pricing plans were updated. Furthermore, loading tiles from Google Maps by simply specifying the tiles URL to Leaflet is against the Google Maps terms of service.
If you really want to use Google Maps (but really, why?), you can use the plugin Novo-Map that I used to use on my personal blog.

= Can I add more markers images? =

Yes, you can add your own custom markers in "Travelers' Map" > "Customize markers" in your Wordpress admin area.

= Is this plugin only available in English? =
Since version 1.0.0, this plugin has English and French version. You can contribute and [translate the plugin into your language] (https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/travelers-map/)! Thank you.

= My markers' thumbnails are heavy and long to load, what can I do ? =
Travelers' map is creating a small thumbnail size for your popups, however, Wordpress is not regenerating thumbnails for the images you uploaded before activating the plugin. To do that, you can install a plugin called "Regenerate Thumbnails" by Alex Mills.

= Can I add two maps on the same page? =
Yes you can since version 1.5.0, you can add multiple shortcodes on the same page.

= Can I change the marker popup style? =
Yes you can, since version 0.9.0. You can also disable the plugin's CSS to customize.
