Geolocate your posts and display them on an interactive OpenStreetMap map using a simple shortcode. Customize your markers and map. 


== Description ==
Travelers' Map allows you to display your blog posts on a dynamic map using the Leaflet module and OpenStreetMap open data. This plugin is entirely free.

How to use: [Get started with Travelers' Map](https://camilles-travels.com/get-started-with-travelers-map-wordpress-plugin/)

= Features of Travelers' Map =

* **Geolocalize your posts, pages or custom post types** on a map and choose the marker image. A **search module** is available to quickly locate the desired location.
* Add your own images to **customize your markers**.
* **Insert a dynamic map** that displays your articles using a **simple shortcode**. Choose the dimensions of your map.
* **Filter the posts** you want to display on the map by their type, categories and tags.
* **Markers clustering** is automatic when marker density is too high, to prevent them from overlapping.
* **Customize** the appearance of your maps with OpenStreetMap tile providers. By default, the plugin uses CARTO's free and open "Voyager" map tiles.
* **Customize** the popup style and content for your markers. You can also disable the plugin's CSS if you want to design your own popups.
* Travelers' Map is **compatible with the new Gutenberg editor** and the classic editor.
* This plugin **does not add any tables into your database**.

The geolocation data of your posts are saved as meta-data and **are not deleted if Travelers' Map is disabled or deleted**. However, if you want to uninstall Travelers' Map permanently, an option is available to **clean your database of any data added by the plugin**.

* Added shortcode parameter "max_cluster_radius" to define the maximum radius that a cluster will cover from the central marker (in pixels). Default is 45. Decreasing will make more, smaller clusters.
* Shortcode Helper page updated with the new parameters.

= 1.9.2 - 20/06/2020 = 
* Fixed double quotes in popovers' excerpt from throwing an error and preventing the map to load.

= 1.9.1 - 17/06/2020 =

= 1.9.0 - Major update - 21/05/2020 = 

New features:
* Added custom taxonomy filtering in shortcodes! 
* Added shortcode parameter "disable_clustering" to disable marker clustering. Don't use this on a map with a lot of markers.
* Added shortcode parameter "open_link_in_new_tab" to open the link in a new tab on click on a marker's popup (however it's not recommended, in most cases, you should let the user decide what he/she wants to do).
* Added shortcode parameters "tileurl", "subdomains" and "attribution" to override global plugin settings. This option is advised for advanced users only.
* Added spiderfy for markers clustering: If a clusterGroup appears at the maximum zoom level of the map, clicking on it makes it "spiderfy" so you can see all of its markers. No more problem if your markers are located at the same place.

Changed: 
* Shortcode Helper page updated with new parameters : 
* Added a new "Advanced settings" section at the bottom of the page.

*   Added an option in Travelers' Map settings (when Polylang is activated) to copy all markers from default language posts to their translations (useful if the translations are already created).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this open source and free of charge? =
Yes, it is. This plugin uses [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) to display the interactive maps. [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) open data is used. By default, this plugin uses [CARTO’s Voyager](https://carto.com/attribution/) tiles, which require attribution but are free. 

However, you may have to pay if you were to choose a premium Tile Provider.

= How can I find free tile providers to customize my map? =
You should visit the awesome [Leaflet-providers demo](https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/) to find a tile provider. Some of them require to register and request an API key.

= Can I use Google Maps = 
No, I decided to create Travelers' Map after Google Maps' pricing plans were updated. Furthermore, loading tiles from Google Maps by simply specifying the tiles URL to Leaflet is against the Google Maps terms of service.
If you really want to use Google Maps (but really, why?), you can use the plugin Novo-Map that I used to use on my personal blog.

= Can I add more markers images? =

Yes, you can add your own custom markers in "Travelers' Map" > "Customize markers" in your Wordpress admin area.

= Is this plugin only available in English? =
Since version 1.0.0, this plugin has English and French version. You can contribute and [translate the plugin into your language] (https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/travelers-map/)! Thank you.

= My markers' thumbnails are heavy and long to load, what can I do ? =
Travelers' map is creating a small thumbnail size for your popups, however, Wordpress is not regenerating thumbnails for the images you uploaded before activating the plugin. To do that, you can install a plugin called "Regenerate Thumbnails" by Alex Mills.

= Can I add two maps on the same page? =
Yes you can since version 1.5.0, you can add multiple shortcodes on the same page.

= Can I change the marker popup style? =
Yes you can, since version 0.9.0. You can also disable the plugin's CSS to customize.
